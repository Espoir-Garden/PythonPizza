Python Pizza Delivery Program

Overview
This project is a Python-based Pizza Order Calculator that takes user inputs to determine:
Pizza size (Small, Medium, Large).
Add-ons like pepperoni and extra cheese.
The program calculates the total cost based on the selected size and toppings, demonstrating the use of conditional statements, user input, and basic arithmetic operations.

Interact with the Program:
Enter the pizza size (S, M, or L).
Choose whether to add pepperoni (Y or N).
Choose whether to add extra cheese (Y or N).
Get your final bill printed at the end.

Features
Dynamic Price Calculation:
Adjusts the price based on pizza size and add-ons (pepperoni and extra cheese).
Input Validation:
Notifies users if an invalid pizza size is selected.
Scalable Logic:
Uses conditional statements that can be easily extended for more options.

Example Output:
Welcome to Python Pizza Deliveries!  
What size pizza do you want? S, M or L: M  
Do you want pepperoni on your pizza? Y or N: Y  
Do you want extra cheese? Y or N: N  
Your final bill is: $23.

Skills Demonstrated
Control Flow: Implementing if-elif-else statements for decision-making.
User Interaction: Handling user input with the input() function.
Basic Arithmetic: Calculating and updating the total cost based on user selections.
